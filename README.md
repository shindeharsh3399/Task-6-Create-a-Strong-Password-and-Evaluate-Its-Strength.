3. Entered each password 🔢 and recorded the score 📊 and feedback 💬.
   ## Results Table 📊
| Password (sample) | Score 📏 | Notes 🗒️ |
|---|---|---|
| `12345678` ❌ | [score] | Very weak — short & numeric only 🪫 |
| `letmein` ❌ | [score] | Very weak — common dictionary word 📚 |
| `hello123` ❌ | [score] | Very weak — predictable word + numbers 🪫 |
| `Autumn2025!` ⚠️ | [score] | Medium — decent mix but could be longer 📈 |
| `BlueSky#45` ⚠️ | [score] | Medium — mixed case & symbol, short length 📉 |
| `HappyDay99!` ⚠️ | [score] | Medium — good mix, needs more length 🔄 |
| `B3@chV1b3$` ✅ | [score] | Strong — complex mix of chars 🔠🔡🔢🔣 |
| `T!gerR0ar77` ✅ | [score] | Strong — varied characters & length ✅ |
| `M0onL!ght*22` ✅ | [score] | Strong — symbols + numbers + cases 🔐 |

4. Compared results 🔍 and identified best practices 💡 for creating strong passwords.
   ## Key Learnings 💡
  - Use **at least 12+ characters** 📏🔢  
  - Mix **uppercase 🔠, lowercase 🔡, numbers 🔢, and symbols 🔣**  
  - Avoid **common words** and personal info 🚫📛  
  - Long passphrases 🗝️ are easier to remember and still secure 🛡️  
  - Use a **password manager** 📂🔑 to store them safely  
    
---

5. Researched common password attacks 🛡️ like brute force 💥 and dictionary 📚.

    ## Common Attacks Researched 🛡️
  - **Brute Force 💥**:
    - Tries every possible combination 🎰.
    
    - longer passwords take exponentially longer to crack ⏳.
      
  - **Dictionary 📚**:
    - Uses common words 📝 or leaked passwords 📤.
      
    - random word combinations protect against this 🧩.

  - **Credential Stuffing 🔄**:
    - Uses stolen usernames and passwords from previous breaches to access other accounts.

    - Avoid by never reusing passwords and enabling multi-factor authenticatio📲.  

  - **Hybrid Attack ⚡**:
    - Combines dictionary words with variations like numbers or symbols.

    - Complex passphrases and unpredictability are the best defense 🛡️.

## Conclusion 🎯
Strong passwords 🔐 are a key defense 🛡️ against attacks 🚫. Testing them with online tools 💻 shows how complexity and length improve security 📈. Combining this with good habits like using a password manager 📂 and enabling multi-factor authentication 📲 ensures maximum protection 🚀🔒.
